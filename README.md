# Pewlett Hackard Retirement Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this project was to do a database analysis of employees at Pewlett Hackard to determine how many individuals are likely to retire soon (something management has been referring to as the 'Silver Tsunami') and what departments those employees  are a part of so that the business can adequately prepare. As a part of this, I have also identified individuals who would most likely benefit from a mentorship program under the potential retirees so that their knowledge is not lost.

The primary means of identification for employees is birth date, with retirees determined as individuals born between 1952-1955, and mentorship employees those born in 1965.

### Results
![retirement_titles](https://github.com/Tbrecke01/Pewlett_Hackard_Retirement_Analysis/blob/main/retirement_titles.png)
- There are 72,458 individuals who are likely to retire soon
- Of the individuals retiring, most are in Senior Engineers (~36%) or Senior Staff (~33%) roles
![Mentorship_eligibility](https://github.com/Tbrecke01/Pewlett_Hackard_Retirement_Analysis/blob/main/Mentorship_eligibility.jpg)
- There are currently 1549 candidates who fit the mentorship eligibility criteria
- Of those eligible, roughly half (773 of 1549, or 49.9%) currently have Senior or Leader roles

### Summary & Recommendations
As shown above, there are over 72,000 individuals set to retire soon, with ~70% of the retiring individuals in Senior positions at the company. To replace them there are 1549 individuals currently qualified for the mentorship program. However, roughly half of those eligible already hold Senior or leader titles.

Given the aformentioned facts, Pewlett Hackard will need to begin aggressively hiring in order to fill the vacating roles. It is additionally recommended that Pewlett Hackard broaden the range of those available for mentorship to minimize the amount of 'brain drain' that will occur. Additional queries to gauge how many employees born between 1960-1965 (or greater), and how many of those employees hold Senior or Lead titles, is recommended to better gauge how many employees could potentially be mentored for these roles, and how many will need to be hired from outside. As it currently stands, under ideal circumstances, Pewlett Hackard will only be ably to fill ~2% of the open roles via internal promotion (with real numbers sitting closer to 1% or less).
